This guide covers the continuous integration (CI) pipeline used in HERITRACE to ensure code quality and automate testing.

## GitHub Actions Workflow

HERITRACE uses GitHub Actions to automatically run tests. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml` and is triggered on every push to any branch, and on pull requests to the `main` branch.

### Workflow Steps

The CI pipeline performs the following steps:

1.  **Set up Python**: It tests the project against multiple Python versions (3.10, 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13) to ensure compatibility.
2.  **Install Dependencies**: It uses Poetry to install project dependencies, including development dependencies.
3.  **Start Test Databases**: It runs the `./tests/start-test-databases.sh` script to set up the required Virtuoso and Redis databases for the integration tests.
4.  **Run Tests**: It executes the test suite using `pytest` and generates a coverage report.
5.  **Upload Coverage Report**: The HTML coverage report is uploaded as a build artifact, allowing for inspection and analysis for all branches and Python versions.
6.  **Generate Coverage Badge**: A coverage badge is generated for each branch using the results from the Python 3.10 test run. This provides a quick visual indicator of the test coverage status directly in the `README.md` file.

### Coverage Badge Setup

The workflow uses the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace/actions/bring-your-own-badge" target="_blank">BYOB (Bring Your Own Badge) GitHub Action</a> to generate coverage badges. To set this up:

1.  Create a Personal Access Token (PAT) with access to the repository where badges will be stored.
2.  Add the token as a secret in your GitHub repository:
    - Go to your GitHub repository.
    - Click on "Settings" > "Secrets and variables" > "Actions".
    - Click "New repository secret".
    - **Name**: `GIST_PAT`
    - **Value**: Your Personal Access Token
    - Click "Add secret".

The badge will be generated for each branch and will include the branch name in the badge label.

## Customizing the Workflow

You can customize the workflow by editing the `.github/workflows/python-tests.yml` file. Common customizations include:

- Changing the Python versions tested.
- Modifying the branches that trigger the workflow.
- Adjusting the coverage reporting settings.
