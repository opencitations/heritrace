The Time Vault in HERITRACE acts as a "recycle bin" or a special catalogue for all entities that have been deleted. This ensures that no data is ever permanently lost and can always be recovered.

### Navigating the Time vault

The Time Vault's interface is intentionally similar to the main catalogue, making it easy to use:

-   **Categories Panel**: On the left, you can browse deleted items by their category.
-   **Deleted Resources List**: On the right, you see the list of deleted items for the selected category.
-   **Sorting**: You can sort the items using various criteria. In addition to the standard options, you can also sort by **Deletion Time**, which is useful for finding recently deleted items.

### Restoring deleted resources

For each item in the list, you have two primary actions:

-   **View Last Valid Version**: This allows you to see the state of the resource right before it was deleted.
-   **Restore**: This button will immediately restore the entity, making it active in your collection again and removing it from the Time Vault.

This feature provides a safety net, giving you the confidence to manage your collection without fear of irreversible mistakes.
