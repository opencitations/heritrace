HERITRACE meticulously tracks every change made to your data, ensuring a transparent and auditable history for every entity.

### The Time machine

The "Time Machine" provides a complete version history for each entity. Every time an entity is created, modified, or deleted, HERITRACE generates a new snapshot.

Each snapshot in the timeline contains detailed provenance metadata:
-   **Timestamp**: When the change was made.
-   **Responsible Agent**: Who made the change (logged in via ORCID).
-   **Primary Source**: The data source that informed the change.
-   **Modifications**: A clear list of what was added or removed.

### How to view and restore a previous version

Restoring an older version is a safe, two-step process that allows you to inspect a version before you commit to restoring it.

**Step 1: View a specific version**

From the timeline, find the snapshot you are interested in and click the **"View version"** button.

**Step 2: Inspect and restore**

This will take you to a dedicated page showing the entity *exactly as it existed at that point in time*. The page displays a complete reconstruction of the resource, including all its metadata and linked entities from that specific snapshot.

On this page, you can:
-   Review the historical state of the entity in detail.
-   Click the **"Restore this Version"** button to revert the entity to this state.

When you restore a version, HERITRACE also ensures that all linked resources are adjusted accordingly to maintain data consistency across your collection.

### The Time vault

Deleted entities are not permanently removed from HERITRACE. Instead, they are moved to the [**Time Vault**](../time-vault). This acts as a "recycle bin," allowing you to browse deleted items, review their history, and restore them if needed. This feature ensures that no data is ever lost accidentally.
