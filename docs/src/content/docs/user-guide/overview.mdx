HERITRACE is a web-based tool designed for galleries, libraries, archives, and museums (GLAM) that lets domain experts manage semantic metadata without requiring technical knowledge. This guide covers the essential operations you'll use daily.

HERITRACE centers around four main activities:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Browse the catalogue" icon="open-book">
    Find, view, and navigate to existing entities in your collection.
    [Learn how &rarr;](../browsing-catalogue)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create new records" icon="add-document">
    Add new entities and metadata records to your collection with guided, validated input.
    [Learn how &rarr;](../creating-records)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Edit metadata" icon="pencil">
    Modify existing entity information and relationships with inline editing.
    [Learn how &rarr;](../editing-records)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track changes" icon="seti:clock">
    View the full change history and restore previous versions of any entity.
    [Learn how &rarr;](../tracking-changes)
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

This guide provides a pragmatic walkthrough of these core features. The system is designed to be intuitiveâ€”most actions are self-explanatory once you understand these concepts.
