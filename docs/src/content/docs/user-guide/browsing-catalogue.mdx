HERITRACE provides a straightforward interface for browsing your collection. While not a full-featured search engine, it allows you to easily navigate and access your metadata records.

The catalogue is divided into two main panels:

1.  **Categories Panel (Left)**: This panel lists all available entity types in your collection (e.g., "Journal Article," "Book"). Each category shows the total count of items it contains. Click a category to view its items.

2.  **Items List (Right)**: This area displays the entities for the selected category. You can:
    - **Sort** the list by different properties using the "Sort by" dropdown.
    - **Paginate** through results if there are many items.
    - Click any item's title to open its detailed view for editing.

This interface is designed for curation, providing direct access to the records you need to manage.

:::note
HERITRACE is designed for curation only, not for browsing or search functionality. The minimal interface reflects HERITRACE's focus on metadata editing and management. Dedicated search tools will be available in the future.
