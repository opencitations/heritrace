import { Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Badge } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

HERITRACE uses a Python configuration file (`config.py`) to manage all application settings. This page covers all available configuration options.

## Configuration Setup

### Initial Setup

1. Copy the template configuration:
   ```bash
   cp config.example.py config.py
   ```

2. Edit `config.py` with your specific settings

3. Restart the application to apply changes

<Aside type="tip" title="Configuration Management">
Keep your `config.py` file out of version control if it contains sensitive information. Use environment variables for production deployments.
</Aside>

## Core Application Settings

### Basic Configuration

```python
class Config(object):
    # Application Identity
    APP_TITLE = 'Your App Title'
    APP_SUBTITLE = 'Your App Subtitle'
    
    # Security
    SECRET_KEY = 'your-secret-key-here'  # REQUIRED: Change this!
    
    # Performance Caching
    CACHE_FILE = 'cache.json'
    CACHE_VALIDITY_DAYS = 7
```

| Setting | Type | Description | Required |
|---------|------|-------------|----------|
| `APP_TITLE` | String | Main application title shown in UI | No |
| `APP_SUBTITLE` | String | Subtitle displayed in interface | No |
| `SECRET_KEY` | String | Flask secret key for security | **Yes** |
| `CACHE_FILE` | String | Path to the performance cache file. | No |
| `CACHE_VALIDITY_DAYS` | Integer | Days until the performance cache expires. | No |

<Aside type="caution" title="Security Warning">
Always set a unique, secure `SECRET_KEY`. Never use the example value in production.
</Aside>

### Performance Caching Explained

The application uses a specific caching mechanism to improve startup performance. Here's how it works:

-   **Purpose**: The cache's primary role is to prevent the application from running an expensive SPARQL query on every startup. This query initializes the entity counters (used for URI generation) by reading the entire provenance database and populating a Redis instance.
-   **`CACHE_FILE`**: This file (e.g., `cache.json`) does not store application data. Instead, it holds a single timestamp that marks the last time the counter initialization was successfully performed.
-   **`CACHE_VALIDITY_DAYS`**: This setting determines how long the timestamp in `CACHE_FILE` is considered valid. After this period, the application will run the initialization query again to refresh the counters in Redis and update the timestamp.

If `cache.json` is missing or the timestamp is older than `CACHE_VALIDITY_DAYS`, the application will perform the full initialization. This makes the first startup or periodic restarts potentially slower, but subsequent restarts will be much faster.

## Database Configuration

HERITRACE is designed to be compatible with any SPARQL 1.1 compliant triplestore, including popular options like GraphDB, Apache Jena, and Fuseki. However, the application has been specifically tested and optimized for **Virtuoso** and **Blazegraph**.

The full-text search feature is used for **internal query optimization**. When `DATASET_DB_TEXT_INDEX_ENABLED` is `True`, HERITRACE leverages the database's native text indexing to accelerate SPARQL queries that filter on literal values. This is a performance enhancement and does not expose a direct search functionality to the end-user. This optimization is currently implemented only for Virtuoso and Blazegraph.

### Triplestore Settings

```python
# Triplestore Types
DATASET_DB_TRIPLESTORE = 'virtuoso'      # 'virtuoso' or 'blazegraph'
PROVENANCE_DB_TRIPLESTORE = 'virtuoso'   # 'virtuoso' or 'blazegraph'

# Database URLs  
DATASET_DB_URL = 'http://localhost:8999/sparql'
PROVENANCE_DB_URL = 'http://localhost:8998/sparql'

# Storage Types
DATASET_IS_QUADSTORE = True
PROVENANCE_IS_QUADSTORE = True

# Features
DATASET_DB_TEXT_INDEX_ENABLED = True
```

### Database Options

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Virtuoso (Recommended)">
    ```python
    DATASET_DB_TRIPLESTORE = 'virtuoso'
    PROVENANCE_DB_TRIPLESTORE = 'virtuoso'
    DATASET_DB_TEXT_INDEX_ENABLED = True
    ```
    
    Virtuoso is the recommended database for its performance, stability, and active maintenance.
    
    **Features:**
    - **Actively Supported**: Benefits from continuous development and community support.
    - **Internal Query Optimization**: Uses its powerful full-text index to accelerate internal queries on text literals when enabled.
    - **Proven Scalability**: Reliable for production environments with large datasets.
    - **Named Graph Support**: Fully compatible with quad-store setups.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Blazegraph">
    ```python
    DATASET_DB_TRIPLESTORE = 'blazegraph' 
    PROVENANCE_DB_TRIPLESTORE = 'blazegraph'
    DATASET_DB_TEXT_INDEX_ENABLED = True
    ```
    
    Blazegraph is an open-source alternative that also supports named graphs and text indexing for query optimization.
    
    **Features:**
    - **Open Source**: Fully open-source and community-driven.
    - **Internal Query Optimization**: Supports full-text indexing to speed up internal queries.
    - **Named Graph Support**: Compatible with quad-store setups.
    
    <Aside type="caution" title="Important Considerations">
    - **Maintenance**: Blazegraph is no longer actively maintained, which may pose a risk for long-term projects.
    - **Scalability**: While the official documentation claims support for up to 50 billion triples, it may exhibit performance degradation with datasets exceeding 10 billion triples.

<Aside type="tip" title="Database Deployment Recommendations">
For optimal performance, it is recommended to deploy your databases using Docker containers on the **heritrace-network** Docker network. This reduces latency between the application and database containers.

While the system functions correctly with external databases, using Docker containers on the same network provides better performance regardless of which triplestore you choose (Virtuoso, Blazegraph, or others).
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip" title="Pro Tip: Managing Virtuoso with `virtuoso-utilities`">
For comprehensive management of your Virtuoso instance—including launching the server, bulk-loading data, exporting dumps, and rebuilding the full-text index—we highly recommend using <a href="https://github.com/opencitations/virtuoso_utilities" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">**virtuoso-utilities**</a>.

This Python package automates many complex tasks that can be challenging to configure and execute correctly in Virtuoso, significantly simplifying database administration.

### Storage Configuration

| Setting | Options | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `DATASET_IS_QUADSTORE` | `True`/`False` | Enable named graph support |
| `PROVENANCE_IS_QUADSTORE` | `True`/`False` | Enable provenance named graphs |
| `DATASET_DB_TEXT_INDEX_ENABLED` | `True`/`False` | Enable internal query optimization using the database's full-text search index. |

## Schema and Display Configuration

These settings control the data model's constraints and its presentation in the user interface.

```python
# Schema and Display
SHACL_PATH = shacl_path
DISPLAY_RULES_PATH = display_rules_path
```

| Setting              | Description                                                                                              | Default                |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `SHACL_PATH`         | Path to the [SHACL schema file](/heritrace/configuration/shacl/) that defines data validation rules.               | `resources/shacl.ttl`  |
| `DISPLAY_RULES_PATH` | Path to the YAML display rules file that controls how entities are rendered. | `resources/display_rules.yaml`   |

## Data Provenance and Versioning

These settings configure how the application handles data provenance and versioning, aligning with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/prov-o/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3C PROV Ontology</a>.

```python
# Provenance and Versioning
DATASET_GENERATION_TIME = '2024-09-16T00:00:00+02:00'
PRIMARY_SOURCE = 'https://doi.org/your-doi'
CHANGE_TRACKING_CONFIG = os.path.join(BASE_HERITRACE_DIR, 'change_tracking.json')
```

| Setting                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                          | Default                |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `PRIMARY_SOURCE`          | Defines the default primary source (DOI/URL). This value is used for the `prov:hadPrimarySource` property. It's used for the initial dataset import and proposed as the default when creating or modifying entities. | Required               |
| `DATASET_GENERATION_TIME`   | Specifies the creation timestamp for a pre-existing dataset. This value is used for the `prov:generatedAtTime` property in the initial historical snapshot.                                          | Current time           |
| `CHANGE_TRACKING_CONFIG`  | Path to the change tracking configuration. This file is **generated automatically** by the underlying <a href="https://github.com/opencitations/time-agnostic-library" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time-agnostic-library</a> based on the provenance database endpoint. The default location is generally sufficient. | `change_tracking.json` |

## URI Generation

The `URI_GENERATOR` and `COUNTER_HANDLER` settings work together to define how new, unique identifiers are created for entities within the system.

```python
# URI Generation
URI_GENERATOR = meta_uri_generator
COUNTER_HANDLER = counter_handler
```

### URI_GENERATOR

This setting specifies the class responsible for generating new URIs. Whenever a new entity is created, HERITRACE calls the `generate_uri` method of the object assigned to this setting.

A valid URI generator class must inherit from the abstract base class `heritrace.uri_generator.URIGenerator` and implement the `generate_uri(entity_type)` method. The abstract class also defines an `initialize_counters(sparql)` method.

-   **`generate_uri(entity_type)`**: This is the core method responsible for returning a new, unique URI as a string based on the entity's type.
-   **`initialize_counters(sparql)`**: This method is specifically for URI strategies that use sequential counters. It's called at application startup to query the database and determine the last-used identifier, preventing duplicates. If your `URI_GENERATOR` does not rely on counters (e.g., if it uses UUIDs), this method can have an empty implementation (`pass`).

This structure allows you to implement custom URI generation schemes tailored to your specific project needs. HERITRACE's default implementation is `MetaURIGenerator`, designed to create URIs compliant with the OpenCitations Meta standard.

<Aside type="note" title="Example: A UUID-Based URI Generator">
Here is an example of a generator that uses UUIDs instead of counters. This approach guarantees uniqueness without needing a persistent counter.

```python
import uuid
from heritrace.uri_generator.uri_generator import URIGenerator

class UUIDURIGenerator(URIGenerator):
    """
    A simple URI generator that creates unique URIs using UUIDs.
    This generator does not rely on sequential counters.
    """
    def __init__(self, base_iri: str):
        self.base_iri = base_iri.rstrip('/')

    def generate_uri(self, entity_type: str | None = None) -> str:
        """
        Generates a new URI by appending a new UUID to the base IRI.
        The entity_type is ignored in this implementation.
        """
        return f"{self.base_iri}/{uuid.uuid4()}"

    def initialize_counters(self, sparql) -> None:
        """
        This method is not needed for a UUID-based generator,
        so it has an empty implementation.
        """
        pass
```
</Aside>

### COUNTER_HANDLER

<Aside type="caution">
The `COUNTER_HANDLER` is only required if your `URI_GENERATOR` uses a counter-based strategy. If you use a different approach (like the UUID example above), this component is not needed and can be omitted from the configuration.
</Aside>

The `COUNTER_HANDLER` is a component designed to work with **counter-based** URI generators. It manages the persistent state of the numerical counters. While optional, it is crucial for ensuring URI uniqueness across application restarts when using a counter-based strategy.

A custom counter handler should implement the following methods:
-   **`read_counter(entity_name: str) -> int`**: Returns the current counter value for a given entity type. Should return `0` if the counter doesn't exist.
-   **`set_counter(new_value: int, entity_name: str)`**: Sets the counter for an entity type to a specific value.
-   **`increment_counter(entity_name: str) -> int`**: Atomically increments the counter for an entity type by one and returns the new value.
-   **`close()`**: Closes any open connections (e.g., to a database).

The default implementation, `MetaCounterHandler`, uses a **Redis** database to store these counters. This provides a fast and reliable way to persist the counter state.

<Aside type="note" title="Example: A Simple In-Memory Counter Handler">
Here is an example of a minimal, non-persistent counter handler. **Note:** This is for demonstration only and is not suitable for production, as counter values will be lost on application restart.

```python
import threading

class InMemoryCounterHandler:
    """
    A simple, non-persistent counter handler that stores counters in memory.
    
    This implementation is for demonstration purposes only. It is NOT 
    suitable for production as all counter states will be lost when the 
    application restarts.
    """
    def __init__(self):
        self._counters = {}
        self._lock = threading.Lock()

    def set_counter(self, new_value: int, entity_name: str) -> None:
        """Sets the counter for a given entity type to a specific value."""
        with self._lock:
            self._counters[entity_name] = new_value

    def read_counter(self, entity_name: str) -> int:
        """Reads the current value of a counter, returning 0 if not found."""
        with self._lock:
            return self._counters.get(entity_name, 0)

    def increment_counter(self, entity_name: str) -> int:
        """Increments a counter by one and returns the new value."""
        with self._lock:
            current_value = self._counters.get(entity_name, 0)
            new_value = current_value + 1
            self._counters[entity_name] = new_value
            return new_value
    
    def close(self):
        """No action needed for the in-memory handler."""
        pass
```

## ORCID Integration

### Basic Setup

```python
# ORCID OAuth Configuration
ORCID_CLIENT_ID = 'your-client-id'
ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET = 'your-client-secret'

# ORCID Endpoints
ORCID_AUTHORIZE_URL = 'https://orcid.org/oauth/authorize'
ORCID_TOKEN_URL = 'https://orcid.org/oauth/token'
ORCID_API_URL = 'https://pub.orcid.org/v2.1'
ORCID_SCOPE = '/authenticate'

# Access Control
ORCID_WHITELIST = [
    'your-allowed-orcid-1',
    'https://orcid.org/your-allowed-orcid-2' # Full URLs are also supported
]
```

### Setting Up ORCID

1.  **Create an ORCID Account**: If you don't already have one, <a href="https://orcid.org/register" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">create an ORCID account</a>.

2.  **Get Credentials**:
    - Go to <a href="https://orcid.org/developer-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ORCID Developer Tools</a>.
    - Create a new application and note your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

3.  **Configure Redirect URI**:
    - In your ORCID application settings, add the redirect URI. The path is `/auth/callback`.
    - **For local development**: `https://127.0.0.1:5000/auth/callback`
    - **For production**: `https://your-domain.com/auth/callback`

4.  **Add Credentials to `config.py`**:
    Update your `config.py` with the credentials from ORCID.
    ```python
    ORCID_CLIENT_ID = 'APP-XXXXXXXXXX'  # From ORCID registration
    ORCID_CLIENT_SECRET = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx'
    ```

5.  **Whitelist Your ORCID ID**:
    To enable access, you must add authorized ORCID iDs to the `ORCID_WHITELIST`. The application automatically extracts the ID from full ORCID URLs, so you can use either format.

    ```python
    # Allow specific researchers by ID or full URL
    ORCID_WHITELIST = [
        '0000-0002-1825-0097',                # Josiah Carberry (ID only)
        'https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5109-3700' # Another researcher (Full URL)
    ]
    ```

## Internationalization

<Aside type="caution" title="Work in Progress">
HERITRACE includes support for multiple languages, although this functionality is still under active development. While the framework is in place to handle translations, the application does not yet provide a user interface for switching languages. The settings below are for development purposes.
</Aside>

```python
# Language Support
LANGUAGES = ['en', 'it']
BABEL_TRANSLATION_DIRECTORIES = os.path.join(
    BASE_HERITRACE_DIR, 
    'babel', 
    'translations'
)
```

## Entity Handling Strategies

HERITRACE provides configurable strategies to manage how the application handles entities that are left without connections after a deletion. These strategies apply to two distinct types of entities: **orphans** and **proxies**.

```python
# Entity Handling Strategies
ORPHAN_HANDLING_STRATEGY = OrphanHandlingStrategy.ASK
PROXY_HANDLING_STRATEGY = ProxyHandlingStrategy.DELETE
```

### Strategy Options

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Orphan Handling">
    An **orphan** is an entity that is no longer referenced by any other entity in the database. For example, if you remove the last author from a book, the author's record becomes an orphan if no other books or entities refer to it.

    This strategy controls what happens to these orphaned entities:
    - `ASK`: (Default) Prompts the user for confirmation before deleting any orphaned entities.
    - `DELETE`: Automatically deletes any entities that become orphans as a result of a deletion.
    - `KEEP`: Keeps the orphaned entities in the database, even if they are no longer connected to anything.
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Proxy Handling">
    A **proxy** (or **intermediate**) entity is a resource that links two other entities, often to add specific attributes to their relationship. For example, a `pro:RoleInTime` entity can connect a `foaf:Person` to a `fabio:Book`, defining their role as an `author`.

    When the primary relationship (e.g., the book's author entry) is deleted, this strategy determines what happens to the intermediate `pro:RoleInTime` entity:
    - `DELETE`: (Default) Automatically deletes the intermediate entity.
    - `ASK`: Prompts the user for confirmation before deleting.
    - `KEEP`: Retains the intermediate entity in the database.

    #### Defining a Proxy Relationship
    
    A property is treated as a proxy relationship in `resources/display_rules.yaml` by using the `intermediateRelation` key. This key tells HERITRACE to create an intermediate entity to connect the subject to the target object.

    You must specify two things under `intermediateRelation`:
    - `class`: The RDF class of the intermediate entity (e.g., `pro:RoleInTime`).
    - `targetEntityType`: The RDF class of the final entity you want to create and link to (e.g., `foaf:Agent`).

    <Aside type="note" title="Configuration Example">
      In this example, `pro:isDocumentContextFor` is configured as a proxy. When a user adds an author, HERITRACE creates a `pro:RoleInTime` entity that links the bibliographic resource to a `foaf:Agent`. See the [Display Rules documentation](../display-rules/) for more details.
    </Aside>

    ```yaml
    # In resources/display_rules.yaml
    - property: "http://purl.org/spar/pro/isDocumentContextFor"
      displayName: "Author"
      intermediateRelation:
        class: "http://purl.org/spar/pro/RoleInTime"
        targetEntityType: "http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/Agent"
      displayRules:
        - shape: "http://schema.org/AuthorShape"
          displayName: "Author"
          # ...
    ```
  </TabItem>
