# Email for configurators - HERITRACE user testing

**Subject:** Invitation to participate in HERITRACE configuration testing - technical user study

Dear [Name],

I'd like you to participate in testing HERITRACE's configuration features, focusing on the technical setup and customization capabilities for semantic data editing environments.

**What is HERITRACE?**
HERITRACE is a customizable semantic data editing tool that uses SHACL schemas and YAML configuration to create user-friendly interfaces for metadata professionals. As a configurator, you'll test the technical setup and customization features.

**Your Role:**
As a configurator participant, you'll test the system configuration capabilities including SHACL schema customization, display rules configuration, and validation setup.

**Testing Details:**
- **Duration:** 60 minutes maximum
- **Format:** Self-guided testing with screen and voice recording
- **Requirements:** Working knowledge of SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) and technical experience with semantic systems

**What You'll Do:**
1. Configure SHACL validation rules for new metadata properties
2. Set up display rules for optimal user experience

**Technical Requirements:**
- Computer with Docker and Docker Compose
- 1GB RAM minimum, 5GB disk space
- Screen recording software and microphone
- Modern web browser
- SHACL expertise

**Configuration Focus Areas:**
- SHACL schema extension and validation constraints
- YAML display rules customization
- System debugging and error handling
- Integration workflow assessment

Honestly, we really need someone with your background to tell us what works and what doesn't. The tool is meant for people like you, so your opinion matters more than anyone else's.

I've attached the testing package zip file with all the configuration files and detailed instructions, along with the privacy consent form that needs to be signed.

If you're interested in participating, please let me know as soon as possible along with a bit about your SHACL experience level. The testing needs to be completed by **August 31st**.
