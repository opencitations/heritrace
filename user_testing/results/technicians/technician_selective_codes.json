  "theory_statement": "Technicians navigate HERITRACE configuration successfully through a combination of semantic web expertise, pattern-based learning strategies, and iterative validation approaches. Their technical competence enables them to overcome inherent system constraints such as file-based configuration paradigms and documentation gaps by leveraging existing examples, analogical reasoning, and immediate visual feedback. The system supports expert users who possess domain knowledge and problem-solving capabilities but still benefit from consistent patterns and contextual guidance. Success is achieved not through comprehensive documentation or web-based administration interfaces, but through the interplay of technical expertise, discoverable patterns in configuration files, and rapid feedback loops that confirm correct implementation. Notably, even technicians with limited SHACL knowledge successfully complete configuration tasks by relying on pattern replication and system feedback, demonstrating that the configuration approach enables task completion across varying expertise levels within the technical user population.",
  "theoretical_propositions": [
    {
      "proposition": "Technical users with semantic web expertise can successfully configure complex systems through pattern replication when configuration files maintain internal consistency and provide discoverable examples",
      "explanation": "Technicians successfully completed configuration tasks despite minimal documentation by identifying similar structures, understanding patterns, and adapting them to new requirements. This pattern-based approach (copying, modifying, testing) proved effective across SHACL validation and display rules, with even minimal-SHACL-experience participants succeeding, confirming that pattern learning compensates for knowledge gaps."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Immediate visual feedback in configuration workflows reduces cognitive load and provides essential verification for technical users, accelerating task completion and increasing confidence",
      "explanation": "Immediate feedback loops allowed technicians to validate understanding, confirm correct syntax, and iterate rapidly without external documentation. Tight integration between file-based configuration and visual representation bridged backend-frontend gaps, with participants emphasizing that real-time visualization aided understanding both what needed configuration and how to configure it."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Mental model mismatches between web-based interfaces and file-based configuration create initial friction that technical expertise can overcome but represents an architectural trade-off that affects discoverability",
      "explanation": "Technicians initially searched for web-based configuration options before discovering the file-based approach. This expectation reflects common architectural patterns in modern systems. While technical users adapted once they understood the paradigm, this mismatch represents a conceptual barrier addressable through better signposting or hybrid approaches."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Semantic reasoning capabilities enable technical users to translate natural language requirements into formal constraints and infer technical details from domain knowledge, reducing dependency on prescriptive documentation",
      "explanation": "Technicians created SHACL constraints from task descriptions without step-by-step guidance by inferring datatypes from semantics, specifying constraints from requirements, and verifying structural consistency. Domain expertise compensates for documentation gaps, though uncertainty around optional parameters shows even experts benefit from explicit documentation of implicit rules. First-time SHACL users successfully implemented constraints, confirming semantic reasoning extends beyond prior technology-specific knowledge."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Iterative testing approaches and exploratory learning strategies characterize technical user behavior when working with configuration systems that provide rapid feedback and consistent patterns",
      "explanation": "Rather than exhaustively studying documentation, technicians preferred making changes, testing results, and refining based on observations. This trial-and-error methodology succeeds when systems provide immediate feedback and failures are low-cost and reversible. Participants leveraged version restoration to safely test configuration hypotheses, reflecting confidence in diagnosing and correcting issues through experimentation."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "File-based configuration systems create architectural sustainability challenges when they combine intuitive user interfaces with technically complex configuration layers, establishing persistent dependency on expert-non-expert collaboration that may not be sustainable at individual project scales",
      "explanation": "User-facing interfaces remain intuitive while underlying configuration requires technical expertise. Realistic usage patterns involve technical experts performing initial configuration while non-technical users handle data entry, but iterative real-world use means non-technical users inevitably discover missing features requiring ongoing technical support. This dependency structure raises sustainability questions, particularly when Docker deployment, semantic web knowledge, and computational thinking mindsets compound barriers. The gap between expecting such support and receiving it represents a critical architectural consideration for long-term viability."
