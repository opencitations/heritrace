  "core_category": "Expert-driven configuration through pattern-based learning and semantic reasoning",
  "theory_statement": "Technicians navigate HERITRACE configuration successfully through a combination of semantic web expertise, pattern-based learning strategies, and iterative validation approaches. Their technical competence enables them to overcome inherent system constraints such as file-based configuration paradigms and documentation gaps by leveraging existing examples, analogical reasoning, and immediate visual feedback. The system supports expert users who possess domain knowledge and problem-solving capabilities but still benefit from consistent patterns and contextual guidance. Success is achieved not through comprehensive documentation or web-based administration interfaces, but through the interplay of technical expertise, discoverable patterns in configuration files, and rapid feedback loops that confirm correct implementation.",
  "theoretical_propositions": [
    {
      "proposition": "Technical users with semantic web expertise can successfully configure complex systems through pattern replication when configuration files maintain internal consistency and provide discoverable examples",
      "explanation": "This explains why technicians successfully completed configuration tasks despite minimal documentation. Their ability to identify similar existing structures, understand underlying patterns, and adapt them to new requirements demonstrates that consistent configuration design enables learning by example. The pattern-based approach (copying, modifying, and testing) proved effective across both SHACL validation and display rule configuration."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Immediate visual feedback in configuration workflows reduces cognitive load and provides essential verification for technical users, accelerating task completion and increasing confidence",
      "explanation": "This explains the high value technicians placed on seeing configuration changes reflected instantly in the UI. The immediate feedback loop allowed them to validate their understanding, confirm correct syntax and semantics, and iterate rapidly without consulting external documentation. This tight integration between file-based configuration and visual representation bridged the gap between backend configuration and frontend behavior."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Mental model mismatches between web-based interfaces and file-based configuration create initial friction that technical expertise can overcome but represents an architectural trade-off that affects discoverability",
      "explanation": "This explains why technicians initially searched for configuration options within the web interface before realizing the file-based approach. The expectation that a web application would provide web-based administration reflects common architectural patterns in modern systems. While technical users successfully adapted once they understood the paradigm, this mismatch represents a conceptual barrier that could be addressed through better signposting or hybrid approaches."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Semantic reasoning capabilities enable technical users to translate natural language requirements into formal constraints and infer technical details from domain knowledge, reducing dependency on prescriptive documentation",
      "explanation": "This explains how technicians successfully created SHACL constraints from task descriptions without step-by-step guidance. Their ability to infer datatypes from property semantics, specify constraints from requirements, and verify structural consistency demonstrates that domain expertise compensates for documentation gaps. However, uncertainty around optional parameters suggests that even expert users benefit from explicit documentation of implicit rules and conventions."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Iterative testing approaches and exploratory learning strategies characterize technical user behavior when working with configuration systems that provide rapid feedback and consistent patterns",
      "explanation": "This explains the pragmatic problem-solving style observed across technicians. Rather than exhaustively studying documentation before implementation, they preferred to make changes, test results, and refine their approach based on observations. This trial-and-error methodology succeeds when the system provides immediate feedback and when failures are low-cost and easily reversible. The approach reflects confidence in their ability to diagnose and correct issues through experimentation."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "File-based configuration systems create architectural sustainability challenges when they combine intuitive user interfaces with technically complex configuration layers, establishing persistent dependency on expert-non-expert collaboration that may not be sustainable at individual project scales",
      "explanation": "This explains the fundamental paradox identified where user-facing interfaces remain intuitive while underlying configuration systems require technical expertise. Realistic usage patterns emerge where technical experts perform initial configuration while non-technical users handle data entry, but the iterative nature of real-world use means non-technical users inevitably discover missing features requiring ongoing technical support for configuration modifications. This dependency structure raises questions about project-level sustainability, particularly when Docker deployment, semantic web knowledge, and computational thinking mindsets compound the technical barriers. The gap between expecting such support and actually receiving it represents a critical architectural consideration for long-term system viability."
