## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?
I can see the changes that I have made in the SHACL triples file, in the display rules YAML,
upon saving and reloading, so not live, but almost live changes and be able to act upon them
on reloading the browser window.



### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?
The "Edit resource" part of object page.



### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?
If you have a long word inside of the "textarea", there is no newline until the word ends.



### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?
I can't really think of any.
