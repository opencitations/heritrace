# HERITRACE Testing - Written Responses

## Written Reflection Questions

### 1. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these tasks?

Very much, the immediate graphical feedback was a great help to see if I had met the requests of the testing protocol.


### 2. What were the most useful features for your work?

Being able to modify records data via a graphical interface and apply the changes in the backend in just a few clicks. The provenance tracking is very useful also for restoring previous states of the data. 


### 3. What were the main weaknesses or frustrating aspects you encountered?

It was not frustrating, but having come comments on the default yaml file would have been helpful to understand the inner working more quickly without the need to get back to the documentation.

Also, I tried to set an already existing ISSN value for a DOI identifier and couldn't get it to work.

### 4. What additional features would have made this more useful for your work?

Nothing comes to mind.
