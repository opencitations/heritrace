## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?

I was not familiar with heritrace, but if I were to maintain this kind of data it would be very useful.


### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?

Creating visual options via SHACL shapes is very easy, and with a simple copy-paste I was able to extend the structure in a few minutes.


### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?

No real weaknesses, I think it would be easy to use even for people not familiar with SHACL, with a brief introduction to this kind of syntax (even people familiar with html would understand delimiters of certain "blocks" of code, and probably operates successfully.)


### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?

The Readme file was easy enough to read, the docker provided was perfectly working, and the task was well described. For future implementation, I suggest, generally speaking, architectural modularisation, which would mean e.g. the possibility to replace Virtuoso with Qlever, etc. depending on advancements of the state of the art.
