## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?
I did not encounter major difficulties. I skimmed through the documentation quickly before starting the tasks and mostly followed what was already present in the configuration. Since I already have a good knowledge of RDF, it was quite easy to familiarise myself with everything.



### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?
The ability to copy and reuse content that was already present was very useful, especially since we were provided with a pre-configured set of rules. In the case of an empty environment, I would rely more on the documentation. Being able to see the final result was also helpful, as it made it easier to understand the display rules—for example, what is meant by “appropriate for long-form text.”



### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?
As I mentioned in the video, I initially expected to modify the configuration directly from the HERITRACE webpage. I was looking for a button such as “add new feature/configuration”, but instead I had to edit the configuration files manually. This is not necessarily a drawback in itself, but I think the website should include a clear indication that configuration is handled in the files rather than through the interface.



### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?
First, adding a clear notification that configuration is managed through files rather than the website would help avoid confusion. Second, as a more advanced feature, it would be useful to allow users to add or edit components directly through the website.
