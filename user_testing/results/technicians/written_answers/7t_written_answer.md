## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?

I had no need for looking deeply into the documentation. The Warm-up Exploration was enough to get going with the system, and the cofigurations were enough. The editor pages were not required to complete the task. Only for visualization purposes.



### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?

I had to look into the documentation only to understand where the display rules where taken from. This means that the system is self-explainatory and easy to configure. Also, the documentation seems to be well organized and I was able to easily pin point where things I needed were.


### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?

I would not say frustatrations, but the forms had a few uncleaned routes (see video). Also, I thought I had to add the abstract below the concatenated title (Display title) so I was looking into "deep" customization of the system that don't seem to be possible. This could be a problem if various stakeholders require custom implementation for the editors based on different objectives.


### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?

Seeing the engine that takes the ttl and yaml files to build up the UI. I understand that this test was published in "release mode" with docker, but at least an idea of how this "system work" (meaning the engine that creates the final HTML file) could have helped me in undestand what couldn't be done.
