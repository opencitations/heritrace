## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?
HERITRACE was quite supportive for these configuration tasks. I found the documentation clear and beginner-friendly, even for someone without any prior experience with SHACL. The instructions for basic operations like adding properties, setting constraints, and modifying display rules were well explained. That said, for more advanced constraints or customized behaviors, I can see how deeper knowledge of SHACL or RDF modeling might be necessary.



### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?
Hot-reloading for SHACL files: Although the frontend needed a manual refresh, the backend automatically picked up changes, which sped up the trial-and-error process.

Inline documentation and examples in the config files: These served as helpful references when editing shapes or display rules.

Custom display configuration: The ability to define display types like textarea for long-form fields such as abstracts improved the usability of the form without needing additional code.



### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?
Lack of contextual help in the UI: For beginners, it would have been helpful if the interface included tooltips or links to documentation next to configurable items.

Display rule configuration not fully intuitive: While functional, the way display properties are ordered or grouped isnâ€™t immediately obvious, especially without experience.



### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?
Visual SHACL editor: A guided interface to add or modify SHACL constraints without needing to edit raw TTL (Turtle) could make the platform more beginner-friendly.

Validation helper or linter for SHACL files: Something that checks your syntax and constraints before applying them would prevent common mistakes and save time.
