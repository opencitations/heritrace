## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?
Very good, I found the tasks easy to handle with HERITRACE, and the support made the configuration process smooth and straightforward.



### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?
Having a direct interface that immediately reflected my changes made it much easier to follow and understand the updates I was applying to the configuration files. In many cases, being able to reuse definitions through copy and paste was very helpful. For example, I defined “Abstract” in the displayRules by following the structure of an already existing rule for “Title.”



### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?
At one point, Docker stopped running, but it was difficult to determine whether this was due to a specific configuration mistake I made or simply an issue with my local machine.



### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?
Honestly, I found the tasks easy to handle given the way they were structured and the current state of the tool. Since I have a somewhat technical background, I may be biased in this evaluation. A non-technical user, however, might prefer a reverse approach — for example, rearranging fields directly in the UI (such as moving Abstract to the second position), which would then automatically generate the corresponding entry in the configuration file.
