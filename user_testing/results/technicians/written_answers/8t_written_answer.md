## Written Reflection Questions

### 3. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these configuration tasks?
I didn’t rely on any documentation — I simply looked at how the other fields were structured and replicated the pattern. While this trial-and-error approach worked, a guided or explicit documentation increased confidence in the changes. Additionally, from my attempts, it didn't triggered any error in the UI - so I have no knowledge on how configuration errors or invalid inputs are handled in the UI. Configuration task was easy and quick to perform. 

### 4. What were the most useful features that helped you accomplish your work?
- Easy files to configure
- Automatic server refresh on config update
- Changes displayed in the interface
- Easy and quick 

### 5. What were the main weaknesses or frustrations you encountered?
No frustration at all 

### 6. What additional features would have made these tasks easier?
Having clear guidelines that explain which fields in the configuration files are relevant and how they should be used would be helpful.
