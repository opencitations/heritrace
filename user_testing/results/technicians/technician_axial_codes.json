This trial-and-error process without extensive system feedback may frustrate non-technical users who lack the mindset that technical users find enjoyable.

The core paradox is that the user-facing interface is intuitive but the underlying configuration system enabling that interface is not intuitive for non-experts. This leads to a realistic usage pattern where technical experts perform initial configuration while non-technical users handle data entry. However, the iterative nature of real-world use means non-technical users will inevitably discover missing features and require ongoing technical support for configuration modifications. The participant questioned whether this dependency on continuous technical support is sustainable at the project level, noting that expecting such support and actually receiving it are different matters.

The participant expressed interest in class-level configuration tasks as potentially more challenging than property-level tasks tested, noting necessity for catalog expansion beyond journal articles to datasets and other types.
