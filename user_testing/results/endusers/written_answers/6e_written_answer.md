## Written Reflection Questions

### 2. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these tasks?
Very effectively. Thank you for the very easy starter pack — the installation worked perfectly via a single shell script. I was able to complete the test tasks smoothly on the first try. The interface is clear and the workflow is easy to follow, with a logical sequence of fields that kept the cognitive load low.

### 3. What were the most useful features for your work?
The clean, consistent layout with clear field grouping, and the straightforward navigation and labeling that made it obvious what to do next.

### 4. What were the main weaknesses or frustrating aspects you encountered?
Author data entry felt heavy without an ORCID lookup to disambiguate and prefill. (For the author in Task 1 the integration worked, but I didn’t see general support from an ORCID integration when adding authors for Task 2.)
I couldn’t locate an ISSN field when adding a journal. If ISSN is expected to be captured via a journal database lookup, it would help to surface that path or show where ISSN is stored once selected.

### 5. What additional features would have made this more useful for your work?
- Bulk import of data
- Smart name parsing (e.g., split “Name” into Given/Family with a confirmation) and inline validation/microcopy (e.g., “Given name = first name”)

### Note
When adding authors for new article task I entered Silvio and Archangelo into the Name field and skipped Given name, which resulted in this record: Arcangelo & Silvio (2025). This suggests a couple of low-friction safeguards, like placeholder text clarifying each field (e.g., “Given name (first name)”, “Family name (surname)”) or auto-parse a single “Name” into Given/Family with a confirmation dialog.

Context: In my current workflow I don’t typically use manual-entry tools, but HERITRACE is designed very well and was easy to understand. With the integrations above, it could also plug into more automated pipelines.
