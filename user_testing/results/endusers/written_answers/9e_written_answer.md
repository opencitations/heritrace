## Written Reflection Questions

### 2. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these tasks?

HERITRACE support these tasks very effectively. Looks like a simple to use and very efficient system. Everything seem to be well structured and even non-experts are guided by the interface.


### 3. What were the most useful features for your work?

For me, the most useful feature was the possibility to merge entities. Aditionally, it is also pretty useful the easy update of every entity.


### 4. What were the main weaknesses or frustrating aspects you encountered?

I didn't like the fact that there is no search bar, which makes it really cumbersome to find articles or other elements. Furthermore, the system would benefit from the possibility to go to the next/previous page not only at the beginning of the catalogue, but also in the end (if I visualize 200 examples per page, I find it uncomfortable to go back to the top of the page to go to the following or previous one).
Additionally, as you can see in my video, I found some problems in updating the name of an entity (an author), and I needed to delete and recreate it, but even in doing that, I had an hard time finding the journal article: i discovered, in the end (outside the screen recording) that the article I added for "Task 4" was indexed at the end of all other articles, even though, according to its title and to the per-title sorting, it should have been in page 2, not in page 3.
Finally, it would be good to get a brief explanation of why an updating may be failing (as in the screen recording).


### 5. What additional features would have made this more useful for your work?

- Search bar mainly
- Explanation of errors
- Pagination control also at the end of the page
- Section for authors
