## Written Reflection Questions

### 2. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these tasks?
I found Heritrace very clear and intuitive to use. The error messages during the saving phase were explicit and allowed me to fix the mistakes

### 3. What were the most useful features for your work?
The Time Machine, which allows you to explore previous versions and, above all, to restore.

### 4. What were the main weaknesses or frustrating aspects you encountered?
Due to a mistake I made in following the instructions, I had difficulty completing task 3, as the Time Machine interface did not easily allow me to restore the first version of the publication.
In addition, I do not particularly appreciate the numerous drop-down menus that need to be opened when entering values while creating a new record.

### 5. What additional features would have made this more useful for your work?
I have no comments on this, except for improving the appearance of the new record upload page by already showing the required fields in preview, without the need to open them manually.
