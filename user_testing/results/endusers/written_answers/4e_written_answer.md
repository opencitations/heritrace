## Written Reflection Questions

### 2. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these tasks?
I think that the platform was quite easy to use and direct, oftentimes making it clear to the user the different functionality of the platform and their own development.


### 3. What were the most useful features for your work?
I think that the possibility to employ identifiers for authors, publishers, journals, etc. is super useful and is something that makes the experience not just more direct but also interoperable.




### 4. What were the main weaknesses or frustrating aspects you encountered?
Alright, I have noticed just two frustrating aspects; the first one was when installing it on a MacBook Air M1, I had to adapt the image architecture and although it didn't require an extreme knowledge for me, it still made the installation quite troublesome.

The second thing is more related to the general aspect as I think that it might be good that when inputting a new author or publisher, I am show what I input instead of simply staying in the inputting field and see the final result when I save it.

### 5. What additional features would have made this more useful for your work?
Just the one described above about the fields that can be modified or inputted. I also think that in general it might benefit from a few thumbnails with instructions just for safety as I noticed a few but I felt like at times they weren't as clear as one might think.
