## Written Reflection Questions

### 2. How effectively did HERITRACE support you in these tasks?
It was effective in the tasks I was asked to perform. I really liked the UI in general as it provided an easy way to navigate the data to input. Also I've noticed multiple warnings happening each time some data type was not the expected one 



### 3. What were the most useful features for your work?
Referencing the already existing entities with the autocomplete functions was the most useful I think 



### 4. What were the main weaknesses or frustrating aspects you encountered?
I found it a bit cumberson to add new entities on the fly while adding a resource. There was not enough feedback nor I could see the entity being saved in real time. 
Are the entities saved at the same time as the resource? 



### 5. What additional features would have made this more useful for your work?
I think it would be useful to have a full preview of the resource before saving it. Also I think more feedback when adding entities and more visual separation between the different sections
