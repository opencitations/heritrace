## Warm-up exploration

Okay, so maybe I will switch to English just for general understanding.

So, I am going to start with my first exploration of the system. Okay, the catalog interface seems to be quite intuitive. It will be very interesting to see what this fruit science is about. Okay, it takes a little bit, it takes a little bit of time to elaborate everything.

Okay, so I can here, I think I can upload my records. Okay, okay, I think it's quite complete. I have nothing to add on this.

Okay, so there are different identifiers, title. Okay, it kind of reminds me of Zenodo interface, but I think that it would be better to have a preview, not just by clicking on the single items, but when you access the page, everything that is already clearly open, just like Zenodo does. Okay, let's go ahead with the second step, second task, which is metadata management task.

## Task 1: Edit existing publication record

Okay, task one, edit existing publication record, eight minutes. The first task is to edit the bibliographic record for a journal article. Okay, so I think I have to find a journal article.

It's not clear to me where to find the mentioned article. Okay, now I can see the documentation points here. Okay, I think maybe in the guide, the fact that the URL where the article is put should be at the start of the guide.

Okay, so basically, now I have to add the current Scagel, the first author. Okay, author. Okay, now I have to delete this one.

Okay, so after doing this, okay, so basically, I edited this field. So I both edited the name and the ORCID, and I think I have to confirm. I'm confirming.

Okay, now, great, great. Also, now I have to, task one, navigate to the author page for Richard Carew. So navigate the author page for Richard Carew.

Your task is to merge and duplicate the author, and this is fine. So let's add the new author and duplicate. Okay, so I have to go back to the page.

If I go here, what does it say? Okay, so I have to, it's not clear to me how I have to navigate. Scagel. Now I have to add it.

Okay, I have to go to task three because I realized that I put the current Scagel instead of the first author, but it's not clear to me how I have to restore time machine. Ah, okay, new version. Yeah, restore this version, basically.

Okay, I'm going back to this first, no, what's that? So I'm starting from the first task. So we put edit resource. I will add an author as author first.

If I add one author, how should I? Okay, perfect. Author one, okay. Add identifier, and I will put the ORCID, which is...

Okay, why? Let's write that please. Save changes. Confirm.

Please. Yeah. Okay, so now Carolyn is the first one.

## Task 2: Merge duplicate author entities

Okay. I have to visit Richard Carew. I have to merge all the... Merging.

Confirm. Merge. Proceed with merge.

Okay. This is very intuitive. I really like this new merging.

Okay. It is very, very simple. This one, yes.

It seems very intuitive. Okay, so I think that I've done the most of the exploring, so I have to restore the previous version. I think that I've already done, I have to say, because of my error in the first step.

## Task 3: Restore previous version

But I will go back to the resource, which is here. It's very interesting. Okay, so here I have the article.

Okay, so I have to go to Time Machine, and I have to view version. No, this is not the right one. Okay, yeah, this is one, this is one.

Time Machine. It's very similar to the Drive chronology, so it's easy to use, I think. View version, and after viewing this version, Time Machine.

But no, I don't have the button to restore the version, so I have to go, maybe this is the correct one, I don't know. I don't know why I'm not finding, when I go back to this one, because I have doubts that it's not the right article. I don't know why I don't have the link to restore the previous version, I have to say.

Maybe I have to go back here. But no, because before I just started the Time Machine, I can't, like, restore the previous one. I can't restore the previous version.

I don't know why it's not working now. No, no, no. I think I should go ahead, because I have no more, I don't have the chance to edit it anymore, to restore the previous version.

Right, so I will go to the second part, because even if I managed to restore a previous version as a first attempt, after adding another edit, I couldn't restore the first version. I don't know why the system didn't allow me. Maybe it's my fault, probably it's my fault.

## Task 4: Create new publication record

Now we go ahead to the second part, which is about adding a contribution to the repository. What I'm following is this indication, so I will put it this way, so I can follow all that. So now I'm adding this incredible article with this identifier, which is a DOI.

Okay. Then we have the title. Okay.

Now we have the authors, with Arcangelo's ORCID, and then we have Silvio's ORCID.

Now that we're at the publisher, which is... okay, then we have to add date, which is right there. Then I'm adding the pages. Issue number 20, volume number 9, journal. Okay.

So. Okay. Identifier.

It's not clear to me what. So journal, I put the journal. Okay, so we have the volume number.

Okay. The journal is digital. Volume number.

Issue number. Okay. It seems quite right to me now.

Add new record. So, yeah, basically. Okay.

Yeah, I think I have to put this one, right? That seems quite right to me. Okay. Okay.

I think I can stop the recording here and provide the questionnaire and the written reception.
