# Participant 6e - Usability Test Transcription

## Warm up

I've downloaded the package and installed it and it works really well and easy. Okay, so I'm starting with the tasks. So, here we have a very nice interface.

I think that the catalog is the point we are looking for. Okay, loading 100 of items takes a little bit time. We have an option to add new record and something like time vault.

I can assume that there is for the deleted resources. Okay, let's try to look at the items how they look like. Okay, here is the main information.

Edit, delete, the type of resource. No issue. Okay, number 1, volume.

I think there is a list of references. Okay, it's pretty clear.

## Task 1: Edit a bibliographic record by adding an author

So, the first task is to edit a specific bibliographic record and we can try to find it by link.

Aha, we have it. It's exactly what we were looking for. So, we have to make some changes in the authors lists.

We can try to make it this way. We need to add new author. That's interesting.

Type of the agent. Do we have an identifier? Yeah, we have it. We have an identifier.

It's ORCID. Okay, and it's quite easy to find exactly the author we need. So, what we need to do to add this author.

Here is the link to the author, but did we add it? Yeah, I think so, but how we can change? Aha, we can make it like this. Pretty clear. Okay.

So, we have first author, Caroline Scagel. Is this all we need? Save changes. We need to confirm.

Okay, it looks like we did. Let's check. Yeah, we have the first author.

Caroline. Great. Pretty easy, like two minutes, I think.

## Task 2: Merge duplicate author entities

We need to merge duplicate author entities. Return to this journal article. Okay, we are here.

Navigate to the author page for Richard. Richard. Yeah, here is Richard.

Okay. Your task is to merge any duplicate author entities you find. Aha, we have similar resources with different identifiers.

So, we have this one for this author and another two of them. Okay. Okay, we can trust that this Richard and these two Richards are the same, so we have to merge.

Okay, this one we keep. Which one we need to keep? Not really clear, but okay, we will merge this one and we will merge the next one also. Okay, but did we do it? It looks like the second time it wasn't successful or we need to do anything else.

Okay, we proceed with merge. Yeah, now no similar resources are found. So, it looks like we completed the task, right? Okay, the next task, third one.

## Task 3: Use the time machine to restore a previous version

You realize that the modification you made in task one was incorrect. Use the integrated time machine system to restore the record to the version before you added Caroline Scagel as an author. But we have no deleted resources in the time vault.

And there is no time machine. Maybe we need to return... Hmm, that's interesting. It seems that on some step before we just opened a new window and that's why we couldn't merge this.

Okay, I think that we will view in the details instead of confirm merge. We have some history in the browser, but it's not pretty clear which item we need here. So, okay, which item we need here.

So, we're just looking at it this way. Okay, we are back to the article page and we have here the time machine. So, it's not time vault, it's time machine.

Okay, and we need to restore previous version before we added a new author. Okay, it looks like we have only one snapshot, so we are going to restore it. So, and now we have exactly the same record that existed before our changes.

Okay, it looks like we're done with this task also.

## Task 4: Create a new journal article record

And now we need to create new publication record. It looks like we need this one.

And this is specific journal article, so we are choosing the here journal article. We need the identifier, which is DOI, I think. Yes, it's the first one.

It's not the only one, but it's the first one. So, we have the identifier. We need to insert the title.

Okay, we copy. It looks like we have some artifacts. And we need to add an author.

Arcangelo Massari with ORCID. And we will look for this one, but no author with this identifier. Why? Okay, then we add the author manually.

Okay, and we need to add Silvio Peroni as another author with ORCID. Okay, and again no results. So, we need to add by hand again.

That's strange. There is no integration with ORCID. Okay, so we have publisher.

We have the field. No identifier for publisher. Why publisher have name and given name? That's kind of strange.

Why so? Publisher can be a person, I suppose, but usually it's not a person. It's kind of organization or something like this. We have pages.

We need to add them like into fields. We have date. I think it's publication date.

And we need to, we can't copy, just copy, right? We need to add. Okay. I think this is 10th July.

I suppose so. Not sure, but okay. We need to add issue.

It's number 20. And we need to add volume. Volume number 9. Fine.

What else we have about the journal? Aha, we have the journal title. Yes, and we have where we can add ISSN. No field for ISSN, right? Hmm.

So, we have no place for ISSN. Okay. So, let's check what we added.

We have journal article with the title. Okay. Two authors, publisher name, publication date.

Okay. We have all the necessary fields except ISSN. So, add new record.

And we confirm. Okay. So, we have it here.

And it looks like all tasks are finished. It was pretty nice. Only a couple of points were not quite clear.

But I think we've done pretty fast with the task. So, we are going to fill the questionnaire. And we are going to combine all the necessary files.

Nice. That's all. Bye.
