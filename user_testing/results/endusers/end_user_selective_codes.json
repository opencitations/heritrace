  "core_category": "Semantic system adoption through complexity navigation",
  "theory_statement": "End users of the HERITRACE semantic content management system experience a dual-phase interaction pattern characterized by initial complexity barriers followed by functional mastery. The system delivers powerful semantic data management capabilities but creates user friction through interface inconsistencies, unclear entity management workflows, complex form interactions, user control conflicts with automated features, and conceptual mismatches between user expectations for search-oriented discovery versus the system's editing-focused design. Users who persist through the learning curve discover valuable features like autocomplete, merge operations, and version control, ultimately finding the system effective for their tasks. Success depends primarily on overcoming usability barriers and developing autonomous problem-solving strategies, though system bugs (including delete failures, display errors, and sorting inconsistencies) can create genuine functional failures that extend beyond complexity navigation challenges.",
  "theoretical_propositions": [
    {
      "proposition": "Functional complexity with usability barriers creates a learning curve that leads to eventual user satisfaction",
      "explanation": "Positive outcomes span eight distinct dimensions (interface clarity, merge features, version control, intelligent input, task completion, systematic workflows, entity management competence, and learning/problem-solving), totaling 151 codes. This demonstrates core functionality works well once users adapt to the system's semantic model, progressing from initial confusion to appreciation and confident task execution."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Entity creation and management workflows represent the primary adoption barrier for semantic data systems",
      "explanation": "Entity creation and workflow confusion (12 codes) isolates the main problem where users struggle with timing, feedback, and workflow understanding. This semantic complexity requires specialized interface design approaches beyond traditional form interactions and constitutes a critical threshold users must cross to achieve system mastery."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Interface consistency and user control directly impact cognitive load in complex semantic systems",
      "explanation": "Visual design and form interaction problems (27 codes) combined with data entry and user control challenges (5 codes) show that inconsistencies and automation without adequate user agency compound the inherent complexity of semantic data management, creating additional cognitive burden during the learning process."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Advanced semantic features become valued once users overcome initial conceptual barriers",
      "explanation": "Advanced feature learning and decision-making complexity (17 codes, combining timeline/version control difficulties with merge operation uncertainty) initially confuses users through unclear interface labels and terminology mismatches, but these complex features ultimately become valued assets when properly understood and supported."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "System bugs in multiple functional areas can undermine user confidence despite being distinct from usability challenges",
      "explanation": "System bugs and technical failures (5 codes) document genuine functional defects including save failures, delete failures, display errors, and sorting inconsistencies. These technical failures are analytically distinct from usability barriers, as they prevent functionality regardless of user expertise or learning."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "User learning and adaptation strategies evolve through systematic observation and problem-solving",
      "explanation": "System behavior observations (27 neutral codes) combined with user adaptation and problem-solving strategies (26 negative codes) reveal that users actively engage with system learning through hypothesis formation, workaround development, and iterative problem-solving. This neutral-to-negative progression shows users systematically navigating complexity, though this navigation process generates friction and requires sustained effort."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Missing expected functionality amplifies complexity navigation challenges when user mental models mismatch system design",
      "explanation": "Missing functionality and feature requests (26 codes) capture a critical conceptual barrier where users approach HERITRACE with search-oriented expectations rather than understanding its editing-focused design. The absence of search functionality generates the most consistent frustration, triggering extensive problem-solving attempts and emotional responses that compound other complexity barriers."
