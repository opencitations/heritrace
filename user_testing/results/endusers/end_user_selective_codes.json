  "core_category": "Semantic system adoption through complexity navigation",
  "theory_statement": "End users of the HERITRACE semantic content management system experience a dual-phase interaction pattern characterized by initial complexity barriers followed by functional mastery. The system delivers powerful semantic data management capabilities but creates user friction through interface inconsistencies, unclear entity management workflows, complex form interactions, and user control conflicts with automated features. Users who persist through the learning curve discover valuable features like autocomplete, merge operations, and version control, ultimately finding the system effective for their tasks. Success depends primarily on overcoming usability barriers and developing autonomous problem-solving strategies, though occasional system bugs can create genuine functional failures that extend beyond complexity navigation challenges.",
  "theoretical_propositions": [
    {
      "proposition": "Functional complexity with usability barriers creates a learning curve that leads to eventual user satisfaction",
      "explanation": "The highest frequency positive category (Successful System Features, 41 codes) demonstrates core functionality works well, while negative categories focus primarily on interface and workflow issues. Users progress from confusion to appreciation once they understand the system's mental model."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Entity creation and management workflows represent the primary adoption barrier for semantic data systems",
      "explanation": "Entity Creation and Management Confusion (9 codes) specifically isolates the main problem area where users struggle with timing, feedback, and workflow understanding. This semantic complexity requires specialized interface design approaches beyond traditional form interactions."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Interface consistency directly impacts user cognitive load in complex semantic systems",
      "explanation": "Interface Design Problems (7 codes) combined with Form Interaction Problems (9 codes) show that visual and functional inconsistencies compound the inherent complexity of semantic data management, creating additional cognitive burden during the learning process."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Advanced semantic features become valued once users overcome initial conceptual barriers",
      "explanation": "Timeline and Version Control Challenges (9 codes) initially confuse users, but Timeline Feature Success (2 codes) plus appreciation for merge operations and time machine functionality show that complex features become assets when properly understood and supported."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "System bugs in advanced features can undermine user confidence and trigger self-blame despite being technical failures",
      "explanation": "Timeline and Version Control Challenges (9 codes) includes genuine system bugs that prevent core functionality like version restoration. Users may internalize these failures as personal errors rather than recognizing them as technical defects, complicating the distinction between usability challenges and functional failures."
    },
    {
      "proposition": "Automated assistance features require careful balance between system intelligence and user control to avoid creating new usability barriers",
      "explanation": "Autocomplete Control and Reordering Feedback reveals that features designed to help users can introduce friction when they reduce user agency or provide insufficient feedback. Users need both automation benefits and the ability to maintain control over system behavior, particularly when automated features alter user input without clear preview or confirmation mechanisms."
