# HERITRACE User Testing Protocol

This directory contains user testing protocols for HERITRACE (Heritage Enhanced Repository Interface for Tracing, Research, Archival Curation, and Engagement).

## Overview

HERITRACE is a semantic editor for GLAM professionals to facilitate metadata enrichment and editing. This protocol evaluates system usability, effectiveness, and user experience across two user categories.

## User Categories

| Category | Role | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Technicians** (4-6 participants) | System administrators, IT staff, technical librarians | Installation, configuration, database setup, SHACL schema management |
| **End Users** (8-12 participants) | Researchers, librarians, archivists, academic professionals | Metadata creation/editing, search, research workflows, collaboration |

## Testing Framework

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [01_participant_recruitment.md](01_participant_recruitment.md) | Recruitment criteria and strategies |
| [02_technician_testing.md](02_technician_testing.md) | Configuration and setup testing |
| [03_end_user_testing.md](03_end_user_testing.md) | Usability and functionality testing |
| [04_user_scenarios.md](04_user_scenarios.md) | Realistic task scenarios |
| [05_data_collection.md](05_data_collection.md) | Data collection methods |
| [06_analysis_framework.md](06_analysis_framework.md) | Analysis and reporting framework |
| [questionnaires/](questionnaires/) | Pre-test and SUS questionnaires |

## Methodology

**Two-Layer Approach**:
- Testing protocols provide methodological framework
- User scenarios provide realistic, contextual tasks

**Mixed Methods**:
- Quantitative: Completion rates, timing, error frequencies
- Qualitative: Think-aloud protocols, interviews, observations

## Objectives

**Primary**: Evaluate usability, validate real-world functionality, assess user experience

**Secondary**: Prioritize improvements, assess adoption barriers

## Success Criteria

| Category | Targets |
|----------|---------|
| **Technicians** | 80%+ task completion, 75%+ system confidence |
| **End Users** | 75%+ task completion, SUS score >65, 70%+ satisfaction |

## Deliverables

1. Comprehensive test report with findings and recommendations
2. User experience guidelines and best practices
3. Prioritized enhancement list and training specifications
