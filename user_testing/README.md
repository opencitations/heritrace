# HERITRACE User Testing Protocol

This directory contains user testing protocols for HERITRACE (Heritage Enhanced Repository Interface for Tracing, Research, Archival Curation, and Engagement).

## Overview

HERITRACE is a semantic editor for GLAM professionals to facilitate metadata enrichment and editing. This protocol evaluates system usability, effectiveness, and user experience across two user categories.

## User Categories

| Category | Role | Focus |
|----------|------|-------|
| **Technicians** (4-6 participants) | Staff responsible for semantic system configuration | SHACL schema customization, display rules configuration |
| **End Users** (8-12 participants) | Academic professionals working with bibliographic metadata | Metadata creation/editing, search, workflows |

## Testing Framework

| Document | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| [01_end_user_testing.md](01_end_user_testing.md) | End user usability and functionality testing (60 minutes) |
| [02_technician_testing.md](02_technician_testing.md) | Technician configuration and SHACL testing (60 minutes) |
| [sus_questionnaire.md](sus_questionnaire.md) | SUS usability questionnaire |

## Methodology

**Self-Guided Approach**:
- Participants conduct autonomous testing with screen and voice recording
- Specific task scenarios with structured reflection questions

**Mixed Methods**:
- Quantitative: Task completion rates, SUS scores, error frequencies
- Qualitative: Self-recorded think-aloud protocols, structured reflection responses

## Prerequisites

**Technicians**: Working knowledge of SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language), technical experience with semantic systems configuration

**End Users**: Knowledge of bibliographic resource structure and metadata, basic web application experience

## Deliverables

1. Screen and voice recordings analysis for both user categories
2. Task completion rates and performance metrics
3. SUS usability scores and user experience insights  
4. HERITRACE improvement recommendations based on identified user issues
5. Development priorities for enhanced usability and configuration workflows
