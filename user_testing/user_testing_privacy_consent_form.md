## Study title: User Testing of HERITRACE System

**Principal investigator:** Arcangelo Massari <arcangelo.massari@unibo.it>

You are invited to participate in a user testing study that aims to evaluate the usability and user experience of the HERITRACE system, conducted at the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies (FICLIT), University of Bologna.

Pursuant to art. 13 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation), we inform you that Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna, as Data Controller, will process your personal data in compliance with the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (General Data Protection Regulation) and Legislative Decree no. 196 of 30 June 2003, as amended (Personal Data Protection Code).

## PARTIES INVOLVED IN PROCESSING

**Data Controller:**
Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna (registered office: via Zamboni 33, 40126 Bologna, Italy; e-mail: privacy@unibo.it; PEC: scriviunibo@pec.unibo.it)

**Data Protection Officer:**
Data Protection Officer at Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna (DPO) (registered office: via Zamboni 33, 40126 - Bologna, Italy; e-mail: dpo@unibo.it; PEC: scriviunibo@pec.unibo.it).

## PURPOSES AND METHODS OF PROCESSING

Your personal data, in particular audio recordings of your voice and comments during the user testing session, will be processed by specifically authorized personnel, using automated and non-automated tools, to conduct the research in question and all related operations and activities, including administrative management.

We inform you that participation in the user testing session will involve audio recording of your voice and comments. The data will be collected without directly identifying information (e.g., name, surname, etc.); however, in particular circumstances, the voice recording could potentially allow indirect identification of you as a participant. We specify, however, that the data will never be processed by authorized personnel (e.g., principal investigator and other researchers) with the objective of merely identifying the participant.

**Data processing procedure:**
- Your voice will be recorded during the user testing session
- The audio recordings will be transcribed into text format
- All transcribed data will be anonymized by removing any potentially identifying information
- The original audio recordings will be permanently deleted after anonymization
- Only anonymized data will be used for analysis and publication

The data collected and stored for the realization of this study will be kept for a maximum period of 6 months before anonymization, after which the original recordings will be permanently deleted.

The anonymized data will be disseminated only in anonymous form, for example through scientific publications, statistics, and scientific conferences.

## LEGAL BASIS AND NATURE OF DATA PROVISION

The legal basis for this processing is found, pursuant to art. 6, paragraph 1, lett. e), of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in the institutional tasks entrusted to Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna for the execution of a task of public interest.

Participation in the user testing is voluntary; however, the provision of data is essential to be able to participate in the study in question.

## RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT

Subject to the limitations on the exercise of data subjects' rights referred to in arts. 2-undecies and 2-duodecies of the Personal Data Protection Code, you, as a participant in this study and therefore a data subject, may exercise the rights granted to you pursuant to and within the limits of arts. 15-21 of the Regulation, including the right to request access to your personal data, rectification or erasure of the same, as well as limitation of processing of data concerning you, opposition to processing, and data portability.

**Important note:** These rights can be exercised only before the data anonymization process. Once data has been anonymized, it is no longer considered personal data under the GDPR, and these rights no longer apply.

Requests for the exercise of these rights may be submitted to Alma Mater Studiorum - University of Bologna by contacting Arcangelo Massari at the e-mail arcangelo.massari@unibo.it.

Finally, should you believe that the processing of your personal data is in violation of the provisions of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Legislative Decree 196/03 as amended, you have the right to lodge a complaint with the Italian Data Protection Authority (Garante per la protezione dei dati personali), as provided for in art. 77 of the aforementioned Regulation, or to refer to the appropriate judicial authorities (art. 79 of the Regulation).
