# Analysis Framework

## Overview

This framework transforms user testing data into actionable insights for HERITRACE system improvement and user experience optimization.

## Analysis Approach

**Mixed-Methods Integration**: Quantitative (statistical analysis of performance metrics), Qualitative (thematic analysis of interviews, content analysis), Triangulation (cross-validation across data sources)

## Performance Analysis

### Task Completion Metrics
**Input**: Task completion data from testing sessions

**Calculations**:
```python
# Overall Completion Rate
total_completed = count(tasks with status="complete")
total_attempted = count(all_tasks)
completion_rate = (total_completed / total_attempted) * 100

# Success Rate by User Type
technicians_completed = count(completed_tasks where user_type="technician")
technicians_total = count(technicians)
technician_success_rate = (technicians_completed / technicians_total) * 100

# Task-Specific Success Rate
task_b1_completed = count(scenario_b1 with status="complete")
task_b1_attempted = count(scenario_b1_attempts)
task_b1_success = (task_b1_completed / task_b1_attempted) * 100
```

**Quality Classification**:
- Full (100%): All required elements completed correctly
- Functional (75-99%): Core objectives met, minor omissions
- Partial (25-74%): Significant progress, incomplete result  
- Failed (0-24%): Unable to achieve primary objectives

**Output**: Completion rates per user type, per scenario, quality distribution

### Time and Efficiency Analysis
**Input**: Timestamp data from session recordings

**Calculations**:
```python
# Basic Time Statistics
task_times = [end_time - start_time for each task]
mean_time = sum(task_times) / len(task_times)
median_time = sorted(task_times)[len(task_times)//2]

# Learning Curve Analysis (within same session)
first_task_times = [time_for_task_1 for each participant]
last_task_times = [time_for_final_task for each participant]
within_session_improvement = (mean(first_task_times) - mean(last_task_times)) / mean(first_task_times) * 100

# Experience Level Comparison
novice_times = [task_times for participants with experience_level="novice"]
expert_times = [task_times for participants with experience_level="expert"]
experience_advantage = (mean(novice_times) - mean(expert_times)) / mean(novice_times) * 100

# Error Recovery Time
error_start = timestamp_when_error_occurred
error_resolved = timestamp_when_user_continued
recovery_time = error_resolved - error_start
```

**Output**: Time statistics by user type, learning curves, efficiency metrics

### Error Analysis Framework
**Input**: Error logs from session observations

**Error Classification System**:
```python
# Categorize each error
error_types = {
    "navigation": ["wrong_menu", "lost_orientation", "back_button"],
    "input": ["wrong_format", "typo", "invalid_data"],
    "conceptual": ["misunderstood_system", "wrong_approach"],
    "workflow": ["skipped_step", "wrong_sequence"]
}

# Calculate error rates
navigation_errors = count(errors where type="navigation")
total_errors = count(all_errors)
navigation_error_rate = (navigation_errors / total_errors) * 100

# Impact scoring (1=minor, 2=moderate, 3=critical)
impact_score = sum([error.impact_level for error in errors]) / len(errors)
```

**Output**: Error frequency by type, impact distribution, critical error identification

## Usability Analysis

### System Usability Scale (SUS) Analysis
**Input**: [SUS questionnaire responses](questionnaires/sus_questionnaire.md)

**Calculations**:
```
# Individual SUS Score
odd_questions = [Q1, Q3, Q5, Q7, Q9]  # responses 1-5
even_questions = [Q2, Q4, Q6, Q8, Q10]  # responses 1-5

odd_scores = sum([(response - 1) for response in odd_questions])
even_scores = sum([(5 - response) for response in even_questions])
sus_score = (odd_scores + even_scores) * 2.5

# Group Analysis
group_mean = sum(all_sus_scores) / count(participants)
group_median = median(all_sus_scores)
std_deviation = stdev(all_sus_scores)
```

**Output**: Individual scores (0-100), group statistics, benchmark comparison (target: >65, optimal: >70)

### Feature-Specific Assessment
- Navigation efficiency and intuitiveness
- Search functionality effectiveness
- Feature discovery and adoption rates
- Abandoned feature analysis

## User Experience Analysis

- Overall and feature-specific satisfaction scores
- Satisfaction correlation with performance
- Engagement indicators and session sustainability

- Resource availability impact

## Analytical Methods

### Quantitative Techniques
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Central tendency, variability, distribution analysis
- **Inferential Statistics**: T-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, correlation analysis
- **Advanced Analytics**: Regression, cluster analysis, factor analysis

### Qualitative Techniques
**Thematic Analysis Process**:
```python
# Step-by-step thematic analysis
1. Transcribe all interviews and think-aloud sessions
2. Read through all transcripts twice for familiarization
3. Code each meaningful quote with descriptive labels
   examples: "confusion_about_navigation", "positive_feedback_search"
4. Group similar codes into themes
   example: "navigation_issues" = ["menu_confusion", "lost_orientation", "unclear_buttons"]
5. Count frequency of each theme
   theme_frequency = count(quotes_with_theme) / total_quotes * 100

# Content Analysis Template
positive_mentions = count(quotes with sentiment="positive")
negative_mentions = count(quotes with sentiment="negative")
sentiment_ratio = positive_mentions / (positive_mentions + negative_mentions)
```

**Output**: Theme frequency table, sentiment analysis, key quotes per theme

### Video and Interaction Analysis

issues = [
    {"issue": "confusing_navigation", "impact": 4, "effort": 2},
    {"issue": "slow_search", "impact": 3, "effort": 4},
    {"issue": "unclear_labels", "impact": 2, "effort": 1}
]

# Categorize by quadrant
for issue in issues:
    if issue["impact"] >= 3 and issue["effort"] <= 2:
        category = "High Impact, Low Effort"  # Quick wins
    elif issue["impact"] >= 3 and issue["effort"] >= 3:
        category = "High Impact, High Effort"  # Strategic
    elif issue["impact"] <= 2 and issue["effort"] <= 2:
        category = "Low Impact, Low Effort"    # Minor improvements
    else:
        category = "Low Impact, High Effort"   # Deprioritize

# Priority Score
priority_score = (impact * 2) - effort  # Higher = more priority
```

**Output**: Prioritized issue list with categories and priority scores
