# Email for end users - HERITRACE user testing

**Subject:** Invitation to participate in HERITRACE user testing - semantic data editor

Dear [Name],

I'd like you to participate in testing HERITRACE, a semantic data editing tool designed for cultural heritage professionals.

**What is HERITRACE?**
HERITRACE is a user-friendly semantic data editor that enables metadata enrichment and editing without requiring knowledge of Semantic Web technologies. It features change tracking and provenance management specifically designed for galleries, libraries, archives, and museums.

**Your Role:**
As an end user participant, you'll test the metadata management functionality including editing existing records, merging duplicate entities, version control, and creating new publication records.

**Testing Details:**
- **Duration:** 60 minutes maximum
- **Format:** Self-guided testing with screen and voice recording
- **Requirements:** Basic web application experience and knowledge of bibliographic metadata structure

**What You'll Do:**
1. Complete specific metadata management tasks in a pre-configured environment
2. Think aloud during your session while recording screen and audio
3. Fill out a usability questionnaire and written reflection

**Technical Requirements:**
- Computer with Docker and Docker Compose
- 1GB RAM minimum, 5GB disk space
- Screen recording software
- Microphone for voice recording
- Modern web browser

Honestly, we really need someone with your background to tell us what works and what doesn't. The tool is meant for people like you, so your opinion matters more than anyone else's.

I've attached the testing package zip file with everything you need to get started, along with the privacy consent form that needs to be signed.

If you're interested in participating, please let me know as soon as possible. The testing needs to be completed by **August 31st**.

Best regards,
