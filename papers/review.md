Comments and suggestions to the author

Heritrace introduces an innovative approach to traceability and data management in cultural heritage digitization projects. Unlike other LOD platforms, it stands out for its emphasis on easy of use and provenance tracking, ensuring transparency in the evolution and modification of data. However, a structured comparison with existing applications, such as Europeana or national LOD initiatives, and semantic editors (such as Omega, Wikipedia, ec..) is missing. This would better highlight Heritrace’s added value. The study is significant for the field, but it should better articulate its practical contribution for users, providing concrete examples of how the platform simplifies operations compared to other tools. The paper is well-structured, logically divided into Introduction, Related work, Functionalities, Discussion and future directions. However, some areas could be improved:
The problem is well defined, but the specific objectives of Heritrace should be stated more clearly.
Clearly articulate the practical goals of the platform.
Compare Heritrace with other solutions to highlight its added value.
Describe practical experiences of users with Heritrace
Integrate more references to usability studies and user experiences.

Comments and suggestions to the author

The paper describes in detail the HERITRACE system, “a data editor designed for galleries, libraries, archives and museums”. It starts with an extensive introduction about the use of LOD in “GLAM institutions” and a comparison of four LOD data editors. Then follows a detailed description of the HERITRACE functionality, from search tools to creation of new records, from configuration and customization to provenance management and change-tracking. It concludes with a discussion of future directions.
Since this is an extended version of a previous paper (Di Silvestro and Spampinato 2024, as clearly stated in the introduction) to further increase the overall value of this paper, it might be useful to consider the following suggestions:
- Reduce somehow Section 2.1. It contains only examples from National libraries and European. It is well known that they are rich and can afford projects in LOD
- Reduce somehow Section 2.2, possibly referring to the previous paper, which has almost the same content of this section. Also Section 4 repeats many of the concepts expressed here.
- In Section 3 clarify the relationship between Time Machine and Time Vault. Also, clarify how to import existing graphs. Is it enough to import them in the triple store? Is it necessary to update the SHACL descriptions?
- At the end of Section 3.1 provide some more examples of YAML
- Section 4 repeats many of the concepts expressed in Section 2.2. They might be reduced in favor of describing possible future extensions of HERITRACE.

Overall, the paper is very well written and very clear. There are a few typos here and there.
Second paragraph of the Introduction: “(Hannemann and Kett 2010)2.1Errore. L'origine riferimento non è stata trovata”
In the last paragraph of the Introduction there are wrong references to Section numbers
In Section 4, in the paragraph beginning with “This streamlined usability is particularly critical in…” there is a wrong reference to a Section number
The text in most of the figures is hardly readable

Comments and suggestions to the author

This paper presents HERITRACE, a semantic data editor designed to facilitate metadata curation in the GLAM sector. The paper is well-written and well-structured, aligning with the scope and standards of the journal. The authors clearly describe the motivation, technical implementation, and impact of HERITRACE, making a compelling case for its relevance in digital heritage management.

The paper is accessible and logically organized. HERITRACE is systematically compared to existing semantic data management tools (OmekaS, Semantic MediaWiki, Research Space, CLEF). This comparative analysis strengthens the paper’s argument about HERITRACE’s advantages, particularly in usability, provenance management, and change tracking. The tool adheres to widely used semantic web standards, such as RDF, SHACL, and the OpenCitations Data Model (OCDM), ensuring interoperability with other digital heritage initiatives.
HERITRACE is already deployed in the ParaText project, and the paper provides sufficient details on its implementation, including data availability and configuration files. This reinforces its practicality and potential for broader adoption in the GLAM community.
The paper is highly relevant to researchers and practitioners working with semantic data, cultural heritage, and digital curation, and for this reason I recommend accepting it.

Minor Issues to fix;
- Improve the quality of the images
- Please check the bibligraphic references in the text: there seems to be a missing reference in the first paragraph of the introduction, and at several spots the references are inconsistent (S. Peroni et al > Peroni et al; M.Daquino et al > Daquino et al )
